# get-clean-string

Simple and fase NPM module with the purpose of clean a character string, by removing its special characters and replacing any accents for the ascii equivalents. The module also accepts custom separators and custom replacements (see documentation below)

It doesn't have any external dependency.

## Install

You can install with [npm]:

```sh
$ npm install --save get-clean-string
```
## Usage

The module requires just the string to be cleaned to work.

```js

// Example1: Sorting the countries by the name

const clean = require('get-clean-string');
clean(' remove these: !@#$%^&^*&() ')

// Returns
'remove these'

```

Nevertheless you can define a custom separator

```js

const clean = require('get-clean-string');
clean(' remove these: !@#$%^&^*&() ', '-')

//Returns
'remove-these'

```

You can pass a third parameter with an object defining custom replacements. For example if you want to change the o by 0s

```js

const clean = require('get-clean-string');
clean(' remove these: !@#$%^&^*&() ', '-', {o: '0'})

//Returns
'rem0ve these'
```
